		INTRODUCTION
				Welcome to First Timer! I assume you want to
				get up and running real quick, so below you
				will find the installation instructions and
				important notes so you can get First Timer
				up and running in a jiffy.

		INSTRUCTIONS
		1)	Copy all of the files in the folder PACKAGE into
				your root folder for your website. This is
				important so all you have to do is direct the
				html (and JS if your code goes that route) to
				the package folder, and you can simply leave
				the rest of the Links & Src links as is.
		2)	Copy the CSS refrences, and Javscript Refrences
				into your index.html file (assuming this is the
				on the default page on your website - but if it
				isn't, no change is needed).
		3)	Copy the First-Timer Popup Code. This is outlined
				with very wide comment marks below - shouldn't be
				that hard to miss.
		4) 	Copy the First-Timer Trigger Code. This again is
				outlined with very wide comment marks, below the
				Popup Code.
		5)	Customize! You can now customize First-Timer to
				your needs, and implement accordingly.

		IMPORTANT NOTES
			TABS
			* If you have more than 5 Tabs with small title text,
				I would highly reccomend using just the TABID's
				instead of a TABID + Title.

			PAGINATION
			* When you add the pagination triggers at the bottom,
				you need to make sure what css class is attached
				to each - to be sure that they trigger the next
				page. Below is a simple grid to help organize which
				classes are needed for which types of pagination
				buttons.

					TYPE				CLASS													NOTES
					Next				md-btn, btnNext								none
					Previous		md-btn, btnPrevious						none
					Last				md-close, md-btn, btnFirst		If you do not add the md-close class,
																										the popup modal will not dismiss! It is
																										imperative that you add the btnFirst class
																										as this resets the modal, so if the user
																										wants to reopen it at a later time through
																										your app/website's settings, they can.

			OVERLAY
			*	The small div that contains the MD-OVERLAY class
				controls the dimmed background. You can edit what
				color, or what opacity it is in the directory:
					package/css/custom.css

			IMAGES
			*	If you want to change the background of the pages,
				you can change the images located in the directory:
					package/img/

				You can replace the images in this folder, reduce, or
				add more - but I highly reccomend on keeping them in
				this folder for organization. The linkage to the images
				are in a ' style="background-image" 'line in the page's
				top-most div.
				If you want just a color background, you can edit the
				class TAB-PANE in the custom.css file located in the
				directory:
					package/css/custom.css

			REMOTE TRIGGERING
			*	If you want to remotely trigger First Timer, you can run
				the following line in the JS Console for the website:
					Cookies.set('firsttimeview', '0')

				You can also reset your browser's cookies to re-trigger it,
				or if you have a cookies editor, just set the cookie
				"firsttimeview" to 0.

			COOKIES
			*	First timer DOES USE COOKIES. If your website serves the UK
				please read this website on regards to the usage of Cookies.
					https://goo.gl/lpqF4f

			Z-INDEX
			*	All of First-Timer is built on the level of 2000 in regards to
				the Z-Index. If you want to put content above First Timer, put it
				above 2010 - as some content for the Stepper utlizes the 10 levels
				in between.
