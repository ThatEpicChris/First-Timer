# First-Timer

Version 1.0.7

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to First Timer! I assume you want to get up and running real quick, so below you will find the installation instructions and important notes so you can get First Timer up and running in a jiffy.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy all of the files in the folder PACKAGE into your root folder for your website. This is important so all you have to do is direct the html (and JS if your code goes that route) to the package folder, and you can simply leave the rest of the Links & Src links as is.
2. Copy the CSS refrences, and Javascript Refrences into your index.html file (assuming this is the on the default page on your website - but if it isn't, no change is needed).
3. Copy the First-Timer Popup Code. This is outlined with very wide comment marks below - shouldn't be that hard to miss.
4. Copy the First-Timer Trigger Code. This again is outlined with very wide comment marks, below the Popup Code.
5. Customize! You can now customize First-Timer to your needs, and implement accordingly.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

### TABS

If you have more than 5 Tabs with small title text, I would highly reccomend using just the ```'.tabid'```'s instead of a ```'.tabid'``` + Title.

### PAGINATION

When you add the pagination triggers at the bottom, you need to make sure what css class is attached to each - to be sure that they trigger the next page. Below is a simple table to help organize which classes are needed for which types of pagination buttons.

```
TYPE        CLASS                         NOTES
Next        md-btn, btnNext                  none
Previous    md-btn, btnPrevious              none
Last        md-close, md-btn, btnFirst      If you do not add the md-close class, the
                                          popup modal will not dismiss! It is imperative
                                          that you add the btnFirst class as this resets
                                          the modal, so if the user wants to reopen it at
                                          a later time through your app/website's settings,
                                          they can.
```

### OVERLAY

The small div that contains the ```'.md-overlay'``` class controls the dimmed background. You can edit what color, or what opacity it is in the directory: ```'package/css/custom.css'```

### IMAGES

If you want to change the background of the pages, you can change the images located in the directory: ```'package/img/'``` You can replace the images in this folder, reduce, or add more - but I highly reccomend on keeping them in this folder for organization. The linkage to the images are in a ```'style="background-image"'```line in the page's top-most div. If you want just a color background, you can edit the class ```'.tab-pane'``` in the custom.css file located in the directory: ```'package/css/custom.css'```

### REMOTE TRIGGERING

If you want to remotely trigger First Timer, you can run the following line in the JS Console for the website: ```'Cookies.set('firsttimeview', '0')'``` You can also reset your browser's cookies to re-trigger it, or if you have a cookies editor, just set the cookie ```'firsttimeview'``` to 0.

### COOKIES

### Z-INDEX

All of First-Timer is built on the level of '2000' in regards to the Z-Index. If you want to put content above First Timer, put it above '2010' - as some content for the Stepper utilize the 10 levels in between.
